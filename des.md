<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Demon's Souls </h1>

**Please remember to check necessary global requirements (e.g. recording for a Legend run).** 

**Read the Home page.**

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Champion Requirements </h2>
For SL1 Champion we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:

* Stats
* All Bosses - Empty arena / Souls

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Legend Criteria </h2>

- SL1 NG+5
- SL1 No Rolling/Blocking/Parrying
- SL1 +0 Weapons, Normal Upgrade Path, No Bleed, No Toxic, No Poison
- SL1 Fist only
- SL1 Broken Weapon
- SL1 Blindfolded
  - Not allowed to see the screen, you need a clear webcam stream to prove. 
- SL1 Deathless
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God. 
- SL1 No Hit
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God.


<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Legend Banned Equipment & Strategies </h2>
* Morion Blade. It's too strong. Allowed on NG+5.
* Clever Rat Ring on base NG. It's too strong.
 > Clever Rat Ring is permitted against False King Allant
* Second Chance. It's cheap, granting a second opportunity in the middle of a fight.
* Biorr of the Twin Fangs against Penetrator. Just don't unlock his cell in 1-2.
* Thief Ring against Flamelurker, Old Hero, Storm King, and Dragon God.
* Offensive spells/miracles.
 > Permitted against Dragon God due to a potential run breaking glitch - <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk2-3-boss">visit</a> for more info.
* Multiple cheese tactics or exploits exclusive to this game. In example, using the bow glitch for Maneaters (shooting through the fog) or killing Vanguard (4-1) out of his aggro range.
