## DS2 & DS2:SotFS - SL1 Requirements

**For SL1 Champion we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:**

* Aldia - Defeat Dialogue AND the visible choice to pick _'Leave Throne'_
* Prowling Magus and Congregation - Empty arena
* Ancient Dragon - Empty arena
* Cerah, Varg and Graverobber - Flower Skirt / Empty Arena
* Blue Smelter Demon - Pharros Mask / Aged Smelter Sword / Empty Arena
* All Boss Souls and/or their empty arenas

**Vendrick has to be included.**

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._


## DS2 & DS2:SotFS - SL1 Resources

Advices provided by Xerieh:

1. Use Dagger until having the Mace available. Then, use Mace until obtaining Rapier. Combine Rapier with Cale's Helm and Work Hook.
2. Go to the start of the Iron King DLC as soon as possible so you can get the Dexterity Ring. You don't want to lose Agility if you are rolling.
3. You can use Homunculus Mace with the Strength Ring (or Mace if you don't have this ring) for bosses such as Dragonrider (or Twins), Smelter Demons, Mirror Knight, Ruin Sentinels, Skeleton Lords, Fume Knight, and Elana's Velstadt/Skeletons.
