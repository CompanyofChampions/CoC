> Roles are obtainable for all listed games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines (or Index).

 * [Index](./index.html).
 * [Demon's Souls](./des.html).
 * [Dark Souls or Dark Souls: Remastered](./ds1.html).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.html).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.html).
 * [Bloodborne](./bb.html).
 * [Hollow Knight](./hollowknight.html).

**Please remember to check necessary global requirements (e.g. recording for a legend run). Read the Index page.**

## Nioh - Champion

**Nioh Champion requires all unique bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:**
* Stats
* Every empty boss arena


Optional sidequest bosses are required only if unique. 
- For example, Tachibana Muneshige is required, but the Two Kings is not.

> There is technically no banned equipment. Such banned equipment would not show in stat screen photo for proof. It is strongly suggested that you avoid gear that isnt from NG cycle, and to avoid the overuse of Living Weapon.

## Nioh - Legend 

As of the time of writing, the sole Legend run for Nioh is 
- Way of the Nioh / NG+4 / Max NG 

If you feel that you have an idea for a run that meets requirements, check with a mod beforehand for confirmation.
 
## Nioh - Legend Banned Equipment

- You may not use a weapon significantly stronger than ~300+50 (weapon only); a 310+57 weapon will probably not be a problem, but a 320+92 will be. If in doubt, ask a mod.

  - You may use equipment without level restriction if the fight is flawless. If you take a hit, the same levels as weapon are under effect.

- No Living Weapon spam. You may use Living Weapon, but you may not repeatedly spam it. Also, if you are hit in LW mode, same rules on gear apply (even though you took no damage).

- No cheesing. Methods involving permanent stunlocks, staggers, or collapsing of a boss - such as Iai or SotC quickdraw loops, confusion, moment talisman cheese, and any other unmentioned method - are strictly prohibited. If our mods judge your fight to involve cheesing, it will be disqualified. 

>Example: You may headshot an opponent and Quickdraw them as part of strategy, but that cannot be sum total of your tactics.

## Nioh - Master 

The only currently accepted Nioh Master run is
- Way of the Nioh / NG+4 / Max NG 

Please confirm your run with a mod if you decide to begin a Master run.


## Nioh - Master Banned Equipment
- All equipment and methods banned in Legend runs

- Additionally, you may not use the following:
  - Living Weapon (though one may be equipped)
  - Magic
  - Ninjutsu 
  - Ranged Weapons
  - Any items, consumable or otherwise

>Note: there may be runs that qualify for Legend / Master roles (such as no rolling/blocking/parrying runs); whether these qualify will be determined by mods on a case by case basis. If in doubt, ask one of the team.
